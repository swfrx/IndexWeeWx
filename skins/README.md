This skin produces an index file for HTML_ROOT based on parsing the directories in it,
and creating list of the directories that have an index.html file.

Special rules are currently applied for dokuwiki, which has sguweex.html. I need to see if
changing it to index.html will conflict with the files at [pilots.s](https://pilots.scottishglidingcentre.co.uk/start)
